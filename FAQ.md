### The widget doesn't show up properly on the homescreen.
Go to your homescreen, Click&Hold. Edit Homescreen. Right above thereâ€˜s a +. Click it. search Scriptable. Click it. Then you can swipe two times. The first option  is the small widget, when you swipe once you can add the medium one  (this is the one you need) and when swipe two times it's the big one. 

Does it say "Select script in widget configurator"? Then you have to "click & hold" -> "edit widget". Then choose for Script "NHL-MyTeam-Widget", for When Interacting "Run script".

### I get the following error: 'TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'oTeamData[MY_NHL_TEAM].id')'      
Replace

```
with, e.g.
```
const MY_NHL_TEAM = "TOR";
```
if the Leafs are your team.

Make sure you copied the whole script from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thisisevanfox/nhl-my-team-ios-widget/main/NHL-MyTeam-Widget.js).
Make sure you copy it until the following lines are marked:

1. Make sure no-background.js is installed properly: Just copy [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supermamon/scriptable-no-background/master/no-background.js) as a seperate script "no-background".

2. After that, make sure you changed the following line in the NHL script from

to
```
const NO_BACKGROUND_INSTALLED = true;
